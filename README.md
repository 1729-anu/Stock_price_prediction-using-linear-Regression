# 📈 Linear Regression for Stock Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression**, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to predict stock prices based on historical data. It walks through the entire process — from theory and data analysis to model building and evaluation — using Python and the scikit-learn library.

## 💡 Project Overview

The goal is to build a regression model that can predict the closing stock price based on past trends. This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand both the theoretical and practical aspects of linear regression in the context of finance.
